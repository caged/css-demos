        <p>Photography is the art and science of capturing light to create images that evoke emotions, tell stories, or
          preserve moments in time. At its core, photography involves the manipulation of light, composition, and
          perspective to craft visually compelling pictures. Whether using film or digital sensors, photographers work
          with these elements to control exposure, depth of field, and sharpness, which are crucial in shaping the final
          image. Photography can range from documentary styles that capture raw, unfiltered reality to highly conceptual
          or abstract art forms that use the medium to create surreal or imaginative worlds. Each photograph becomes a
          record, either personal or shared, that holds the power to connect people across time and space.</p>
        <p>n the digital age, photography has become more accessible than ever, with smartphones putting powerful
          cameras in the hands of millions. This accessibility has democratized the medium, enabling people to share
          their experiences instantly. Advanced editing software has also expanded creative possibilities, allowing
          photographers to manipulate their images with precision. From portraiture and landscapes to street photography
          and photojournalism, the practice of photography spans numerous genres, each offering its own challenges and
          rewards. While technical proficiency is essential, great photography ultimately relies on the photographer’s
          ability to see and interpret the world uniquely, using the camera as a tool to communicate vision and emotion.
